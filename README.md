👋 Hey, I’m Harshit — a systems-focused engineer who enjoys building the kind of tech that just works. Whether it's crafting resilient backend services or designing fault-tolerant infrastructure, I focus on the parts of the system that keep everything up and running — reliably, at scale, and under real-world pressure.

At Jumbotail, I work across the boundary of platform and backend engineering — setting up robust CI/CD pipelines, optimizing system performance, and building internal tools and APIs that developers rely on daily. My goal is simple: keep things fast, reliable, and easy to operate.

🧠 I care deeply about:

- High availability and system reliability
- Scalable service and infrastructure design
- Developer experience and automation
- Observability and proactive incident response

🛠️ Tools I work with regularly:

- Infra & Platforms: AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions
- Backend & APIs: Node.js, Java, Python, Go
- Monitoring & Ops: DataDog, Grafana, CloudWatch, Zenduty

I enjoy working at the intersection of infrastructure and software — the kind of engineering that isn’t always visible to users, but makes all the difference when things go live at scale.
